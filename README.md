# Have Another  
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Btan579/HaveAnother.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Btan579/HaveAnother)

### About

Have Another is a simple, no frills place to post and read short reviews on beers you've tried. I wanted a way to share thoughts on craft beer without needing to say alot. All you really need to know is if youll have another.
